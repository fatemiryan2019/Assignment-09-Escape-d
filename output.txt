Uh oh! It looks like you have fallen as the next victim in Ryan's House of Horror! 
 However, I am feeling nice today, it is after all the holiday season, which is all about giving. 
 So I am going to give you a chance to escape.
Here is your gift: You have 30 opportunities. 
 30 opportunities before you earn your spot on our Thanksgiving table, and you would not be there as a guest...
Now, here is how you play our little game to determine your fate, MUAHAHAHA 
 To catch my attention, command help, but be wise as I can get cranky. But by doing this I will guide you in the right direction. Remember, because of my illiteracy I only understand two word expressions (verb then noun). I only understand the verbs: open, read, look, close, write, get, light, and play.  
 I did study nouns more in primary school, so you can command me these nouns: door, candle, book, trumpet, room, note, pen, piano, bench, matches, scroll, drum, chest, shelves, music, and lock.
Lastly, you need to know where you are going. You have four options for this step: north, south, east, and west. 
 Cherish your last hours in this world!

Where am I? Why is it so dark here? As I continue to look around I see that I am in some sorts of a fancy house. I look up to see a door with a gold handle. To the right there is a treasure chest, one that is black, and just sitting on the floor. As I walk around I trip over an unlit candle, that was smack-dab in the middle of the room. To my left is a bench, one that appears to be red, and is pinned on the wall. What is going on?
