Where am I? Why is it so dark here? As I continue to look around I see that I am in some sorts of a fancy house. I look up to see a door with a gold handle. To the right there is a treasure chest, one that is black, and just sitting on the floor. As I walk around I trip over an unlit candle, that was smack-dab in the middle of the room. To my left is a bench, one that appears to be red, and is pinned on the wall. What is going on?

Uh oh! It looks like you have fallen as the next victim in Ryan's House of Horror! 
 However, I am feeling nice today, it is after all the holiday season, which is all about giving. 
 So I am going to give you a chance to escape.
Here is your gift: You have 30 opportunities. 
 30 opportunities before you earn your spot on our Thanksgiving table, and you would not be there as a guest...
Now, here is how you play our little game to determine your fate, MUAHAHAHA 
 To catch my attention, command help, but be wise as I can get cranky. But by doing this I will guide you in the right direction. Remember, because of my illiteracy I only understand two word expressions (verb then noun). I only understand the verbs: open, read, look, close, write, get, light, and play.  
 I did study nouns more in primary school, so you can command me these nouns: door, candle, book, trumpet, room, note, pen, piano, bench, matches, scroll, drum, chest, shelves, music, and lock.
Lastly, you need to know where you are going. You have four options for this step: north, south, east, and west. 
 Cherish your last hours in this world!
